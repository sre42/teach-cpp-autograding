#HW3 Sorted Doubly Linked List

#First-Name Last-Name

TODO - Update your name in this readme.

TODO - Add a badge from travis CI here

##Problem statement:
Implement a backend for a Class that represents a Sorted Doubly Linked List(Ascending order). 
For more information on a Doubly Linked List, Refer here:
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list]
    
You must write code in the class SortedDoublyLinkedList, inside `SortedDoublyLinkedList.hpp`.
The functions that are to be implemented by you are marked with a `//TODO`     


## Constraints 
* The class should support the following Node types via templates:
    * int
* The list must be sorted(Ascending order) at all times.
* The Class must use Node from Node.h to represent a node.


## Files to work on

You are required to work on `README.md` and `/src/SortedDoublyLinkedList.hpp`
You can also modify `main.cpp` to debug your program.
Please **DO NOT MODIFY** any other files. Modifying any other file will result in penalty to your grade.

## Running tests
* To run the program, select the configuration `hw3_run` from the top right and click on run
* You can run the tests using Clion: select the configuration `runAllHW3Tests` from the top right and click on run
* To use Clion's Google test configuration:
    * Goto Run->Edit Configurations..
    * Select the "+" icon on the top left to add a new configuration of type "Google Test"
    * Enter in a name, and also target configuration as "runMainHW5Tests"
    * Select Ok.
    * You can now use this configuration for better test display by CLion.

## Notes
* Make sure your solution compiles and runs. There are no points for code that doesnt compile.
* The Initial template code will compile, but will fail in most of the test cases.
* Look at samples in the class repository for example code.
* Try to first pass addToListTest (Implement the add() function first).
* It is recommended that you add your **name** and **travis ci badge** to your readme.
* Make sure your last push is before the deadline. Your last push will be considered as your final submission.
* Post questions on Piazza if you had any questions.
* Please contact the course staff if you run into issues. We are here to help you!
* look at this video for how to run CLion tests: https://youtu.be/8Up5eNZ0FLw
